**Why is Documentation so underrated?**

**Picture this**: Your teammate goes on vacation. An urgent request lands on your desk, and you open his Power BI report to find a chaotic and massive data model. You scramble for documentation, only to discover a dump of all the DAX measures in the model... Familiar pain? 

**That's the pain of poor documentation.**

Here’s the thing: documentation isn’t just about writing things down. It’s about creating a map that helps everyone: your teammates, stakeholders, and even future-you. It’s not glamorous, but when done right, it can save hours, spark better collaboration, and even rescue projects from chaos.

This topic got me and **Greg Philps** thinking: **What should the Power BI community invest more time in learning, from our perspective, to make a difference?** And, honestly, documentation doesn’t get the attention it deserves. That’s why we’re diving deeper to propose something the community can actually use in their daily work.

Starting this week, **Greg** and I will alternate posting ideas and hopefully useful actionable tips about Power Bi Documentation. These posts will cover different topics related to documentation. 

We’ll save them all on a dedicated **GitHub repo** for easy reference.

How far can we take this? That’s up to you. Jump in, share your thoughts, suggest ideas, challenge our approaches, or propose topics for us to explore. Let’s transform documentation from a  sidekick to the true hero it deserves to be.

**Let’s go!** 🚀
